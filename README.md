ASP.NET Server Starter Kit
--------------------------

> This project template is an ASP.NET solution skeleton for a typical web application or
> single-page application (SPA). It contains only server-side components such as Owin,
> Katana, Entity Framework (EF), ASP.NET Identity, ASP.NET Web Api, SignalR. You can use it
> to quickly bootstrap your web application projects and it's recommended to be paired with
> a front-end project similar to [this one](https://github.com/kriasoft/React-Seed)
> or one generated by [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
